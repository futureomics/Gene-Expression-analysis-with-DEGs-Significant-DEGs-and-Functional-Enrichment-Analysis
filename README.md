# Gene Expression Analysis with DEGs, Significant DEGs, and Functional Enrichment Analysis

🧬 End-to-End Gene Expression Analysis

This repository provides a complete pipeline for gene expression analysis, covering everything from preprocessing to Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) identification, filtering significant DEGs, and performing functional enrichment analysis.

The workflow is designed for reproducibility and can be applied to both RNA-seq and microarray datasets.

🚀 Features

✅ Data preprocessing & normalization

✅ Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)

✅ Filtering Significant DEGs using thresholds (e.g., p-value, adj p-value, log2FC)

✅ Functional enrichment analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome, etc.)

✅ Publication-ready plots and tables
